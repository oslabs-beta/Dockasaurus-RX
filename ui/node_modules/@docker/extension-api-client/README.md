# `@docker/extension-api-client`

This package provides a client object that Docker Desktop extensions can use in their frontends to communicate with the wider application.

The full extensions SDK is in pre-release status, and currently only available to a limited set of partners. This package will be updated to link to the public SDK in a future version.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @docker/extension-api-client
```

## Example usage

```ts
import { createDockerDesktopClient } from '@docker/extension-api-client';

const ddClient = createDockerDesktopClient();

ddClient.desktopUI.toast.success('My extension works!');
```
