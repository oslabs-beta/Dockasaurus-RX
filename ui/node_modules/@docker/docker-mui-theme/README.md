# `@docker/docker-mui-theme`

This package provides a Material UI theme that specifies the basic look & feel of Docker Desktop in an application-agnostic way. This is the only officially supported theming solution for Docker Extensions.

## How to use

Wrap your React application with `DockerMuiThemeProvider` at a suitably high level, and then render a MUI `CssBaseline` component somewhere within it.

For best results integrating with Docker Desktop, also read our [MUI best practices](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions-sdk/design/mui-best-practices/) article.

```jsx
import { DockerMuiThemeProvider } from '@docker/docker-mui-theme';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';

function App() {
  return (
    <DockerMuiThemeProvider>
      <CssBaseline />

      <YourAppContent />
    </DockerMuiThemeProvider>
  );
}
```
